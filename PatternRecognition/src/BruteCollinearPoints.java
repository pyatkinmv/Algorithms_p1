// Write a program BruteCollinearPoints.java that examines 4 points at
// a time and checks whether they all lie on the same line segment, returning all such line segments.
// To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear,
// check whether the three slopes between p and q, between p and r, and between p and s are all equal.
// The method segments() should include each line segment containing 4 points exactly once.
// If 4 points appear on a line segment in the order p→q→r→s, then you should include
// either the line segment p→s or s→p (but not both) and you should not include subsegments
// such as p→r or q→r. For simplicity, we will not supply any input to BruteCollinearPoints that has 5 or more collinear points.
